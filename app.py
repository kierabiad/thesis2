    The dataset for this study was collected directly from cassava farmers‚Äô plantations in Brgy. San Antonio, Kalayaan, Laguna, and nearby farm areas. It comprises images of both healthy crops and those affected by blight diseases, ensuring real-world agricultural relevance. By specifically focusing on blight-infected crops, the dataset includes images of various blight diseases alongside their healthy counterparts for comparison.
Collaboration with local farmers and agricultural experts helps capture the unique challenges faced in the region. The emphasis on blight-related data makes the dataset highly relevant to improving crop disease detection for health monitoring. Blight is a major concern for farmers due to its rapid spread and potential for significant losses, making this study‚Äôs focus both practical and necessary.
The dataset consists of 794 RGB images categorized into eight different classes, with a training-to-validation split of 77.95% and 22.05%, respectively, while preserving the original directory structure. Additionally, a separate directory containing 12 test images was later created for prediction purposes.
